= Documentation

The project documentation is written in AsciiDoc.
If you want to modify and rebuild the documentation, you will need Asciidoctor.
The method I used to install asciidoctor was to install the latest Ruby gems:

```
sudo apt install ruby
sudo gem install asciidoctor asciidoctor-diagram asciidoctor-pdf
```

For diagrams, Draw.io is used.

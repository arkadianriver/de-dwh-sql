# de-dwh-sql

My take on _Data With Baraa_'s Data Warehouse project,
using PostgreSQL instead of Microsoft SQL Server.

[This project's docs are available here](https://arkadianriver.github.io/de-dwh-sql/).

Refer to those docs to set up PostgreSQL on Linux.
Once installed, you can create the data warehouse
with the ETL pipeline like so ...

    sudo -u postgres ./pipeline.sh full

= Pipeline

The ETL pipeline (`pipeline.sh`) is run with Bash, calling SQL scripts run with psql, with output
to the command line and a log in `/tmp/de-dwh-sql`.

To run the full pipeline:

```
sudo -u postgres ./pipeline.sh full
```

There are other options besides 'full', if you want to run isolated stages of the pipeline.
Here are the stages each option runs:

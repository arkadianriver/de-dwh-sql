= Documentation

The project documentation is written in AsciiDoc.
If you want to modify and rebuild the documentation, you will need Asciidoctor.
The method I used to install asciidoctor was to install the latest Ruby gems:

```
sudo apt install ruby
sudo gem install asciidoctor asciidoctor-diagram asciidoctor-pdf
```

For diagrams, some additional packages are required.

```
sudo apt install graphviz plantuml
```

For mermaid, rather than use `mermaid-cli` from the package manager,
I wanted the latest version of mermaid-cli via npm
(after installing nvm for the latest version of nodejs).

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc || source ~/.zshrc
nvm install --lts

npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
```

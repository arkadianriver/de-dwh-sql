= Preparing the environment

This project uses Linux on Pop_OS!, with PostgreSQL as the database management system for the data warehouse.

Before running the data warehouse scripts, ensure that you have PostgreSQL installed and running on your system.
You will also need to have access to the PostgreSQL user with sufficient privileges to create databases and tables.
Currently, the scripts assume that the PostgreSQL user is `postgres`.

To install PostgreSQL:

```
sudo apt install postgresql
```

By default, the service will start automatically after installation.
If it does not, you can start it manually using the following command:

```
sudo service postgresql start
```

= Preparing the environment

This project was created on Pop_OS! Linux, with PostgreSQL as the DBMS.

Before running the data warehouse scripts, ensure that you have PostgreSQL installed and running on your system.
You will also need to have access to a PostgreSQL user with sufficient privileges to create databases and tables.
In this project, the scripts use the PostgreSQL root user `postgres`.

To install PostgreSQL:

```
sudo apt install postgresql
```

By default, the service will start automatically after installation.
If it doesn't, you can start it manually using the following command:

```
sudo service postgresql start
```

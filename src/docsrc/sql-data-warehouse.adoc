This document accompanies the _SQL Data Warehouse project_, created while following
along with the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSKVgrwhzus&t=84064s[30-hour SQL Full course]
on the _Data with Baraa_ YouTube channel.
The project is to build a Medallion-structured data warehouse with a primary focus on using just
SQL to extract from CSV files, perform silver transformations, and restructure and integrate
the gold layer into a star schema.
